My emacs configuration, currently in progress.

I'm migrating off of emacs-starter-kit and the horrendous hack that
was my last config setup.

Some things are copied from emacs-starter-kit, emacs-kicker, and other
configs scattered across emacswiki and other places. As
emacs-starter-kit is licensed under GNU GPL3, this configuration setup
is also released under the terms of the GNU GPL3.

This configuration uses several git submodules so it doesn't grow to
400MB. Use `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` on a fresh
clone to pull down the dependencies.
